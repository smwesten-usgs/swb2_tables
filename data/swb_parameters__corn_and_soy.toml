title = "Base parameters for use with USDA's Cropland Data Layer (CDL) gridded landuse datasets."

# ASSUMPTIONS:
# Only the curve number for hydrologic soil group 'A' is specified here. All other values are generated from the
# curve number aligners.
#
# Please don't even think about changing the values in this file without also changing the source (reference)
# for the parameter values. 
#
# The idea behind this file is to have a clear path back to a source for each type of parameter value that makes it into a
# swb lookup table.
